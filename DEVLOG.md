# Allotment Planner Development Log

This log tracks the development progress of the Allotment Planner application.

## March, 17, 2025 - Major Refactoring and Element Palette Integration

### Element Palette Integration
- Implemented categorized garden elements with SVG icons
- Added tab interface for element categories (Structures, Plants, Trees, Decorative)
- Connected palette to Redux store for element selection and placement
- Fixed drag-and-drop functionality between palette and canvas

### Garden Canvas Improvements
- Developed interactive SVG-based canvas with drag-and-drop functionality
- Added pan and zoom controls with visual feedback
- Implemented grid background for easier element placement
- Added element selection and dragging capabilities

### Refactoring Review
We performed major refactoring of the codebase to improve modularity and maintainability:

#### 1. Utility Modules
- Created `positionUtils.js` for position calculations and grid/pixel conversions
- Added `collisionUtils.js` for element collision detection
- Implemented `elementUtils.js` for element type handling and styling

#### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `elementTypes.js` for standardized element definitions and categories
- Added `gridConfig.js` for grid and canvas constants
- Centralized color and sizing variables

#### 3. Custom Hooks
- Implemented `useCanvasZoom.js` for managing canvas zoom/pan behavior
- Added `useElementDrag.js` for element dragging logic
- Created `useSelection.js` for element selection state management

#### 4. Component Structure
- Split GardenCanvas into smaller components:
  - `CanvasControls.js` for zoom/pan buttons
  - `CanvasGrid.js` for grid rendering
  - `GardenBackground.js` for background rendering
- Extracted element icons to `ElementIcons.js`
- Refactored `GardenElement.js` and `ElementPalette.js` to use utilities

#### 5. Testing
- Added basic unit tests for utility functions
- Created test structure for future test development

#### 6. Documentation
- Added JSDoc comments throughout the codebase
- Improved function and component descriptions

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Element Palette Integration tasks:
   - Fix any bugs in drag-and-drop behavior
   - Add visual indicators for garden element placement
   - Implement error handling for element collisions

2. Implement Garden Canvas functionalities:
   - Add element resizing with aspect ratio preservation
   - Implement element rotation
   - Add deletion of selected elements
   
3. Enhance Garden Management UI:
   - Style garden selection dropdown
   - Improve garden name editing interface
   - Add garden sharing capabilities

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Fixed React hooks ordering issues
- Improved component structure for better maintenance
- Standardized element representation in both palette and canvas
- Added collision detection to prevent element overlap
- Centralized styling and configuration

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed database initialization issue (MySQL "Too many keys" error) by using force sync temporarily
- Resolved React hook dependencies in GardenElement components
- Fixed event propagation issues with drag and drop functionality
